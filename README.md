#Theme Park Management System (PRVMS)
##Project Overview
This is a Java based theme park visitor management system that implements functions such as ride facility management, visitor queuing, and historical record tracking.
##Functional characteristics
-Complete class hierarchy (Person → Employee/Visitor)
-Interface Implementation (RideInterface)
-Queue management waiting for tourists
-Linked List Management Riding History
-Sorting of tourist records
-File import and export
-Riding cycle operation simulation
##Compile and run
1. Put all Java files in the same directory
2. Compilation: ` javac *. java`
3. Run: ` Java Assignments Two ``
